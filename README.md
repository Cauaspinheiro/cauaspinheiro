### _"Always pass on what you have learned"_. - Yoda

I am a full-stack developer passionate about programming and problem-solving, with a focus on creating solutions that address customer pain points and enhance the product experience.

Currently, I am working on developing web solutions integrated with artificial intelligence.

My journey in programming began at the age of 14 when I created drawings on the JavaScript canvas. It was at that moment that I became fascinated with the idea of solving problems and turning ideas into reality. Since then, I have been honing my skills, always working on projects with real-world requirements, learning hands-on how systems work.

Throughout this journey, I have completed courses on platforms such as Curso em Vídeo and Rocketseat, and I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence at FIAP. During my studies, I was awarded for developing AI solutions to real-world problems. I was the winner of the Global Solution 2023.01, which focused on developing systems aimed at fighting hunger and promoting sustainable agriculture, in partnership with Microsoft and Kraft Heinz. Additionally, I was the winner of FIAP Next 2023, where I developed a crop prediction system for John Deere.

My professional experience includes participating in prominent projects, such as building and maintaining Whirlpool S.A.'s reconciliation system, and developing AI solutions for companies like Ultracargo and Piracanjuba. I am also the co-founder of Lovepeople, a startup focused on education, which aims to teach Flutter in a practical and innovative way to new programmers.

Currently, I am increasingly exploring the world of artificial intelligence, developing robust solutions that combine my web expertise with AI. My focus is always on improving the product and user experience, bringing technological innovations that make a difference.
